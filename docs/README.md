## What is EchoFrame?

**EchoFrame** is a roleplaying game engine designed to explore the relationship between a character's core traits, and their thematic capabilities. It blends:
- **12 core attributes** accross 4 domains (Physical, Mental, Social, Resilience)
- **Skilltributes**, semi-independent traits that represent expertise, nuance, and style
- A flexible, open rolling system using `1d20 + Attribute + Skilltribute`

This SRD contains the full open ruleset for non-commercial us and creative expansion.
